# Python-Java-Comparison
In this repo you will find different problems in Java and Python so you can see the difference between them

There are 3 parts in this repo:
  - The Python server
  - The React server
  - The Java server

The main reason that there are 2 servers, one with Java and one with Python, is so you can see how to
solve a problem in python and in java.

***Note: The react server is there so we have a front-end part the Java and the Python server solve the same problems***
