# Python-Java-Comparison
In this repo you will find different problems in Java and Python so you can see the differences between them.
There are 2 main projects here:
The Java vs Python code examples are where you can find code differences but they are not solving any problem. They are just to show the way of writing code.

Second project:
There are 3 files in this repo:
  - The Python server
  - The React server
  - The Java server

The main reason that there are 2 servers, one with Java and one with Python, is so you can see how to
solve a problem in python and in java.

***Note: The react server is there so we have a front-end part that we will use to send data from the user to the Java and the Python server in order to solve the same problems***

## First problem:

Given a name and the age of a person show on screen: 'name' has age:'age'.<br>
Solution in Java:[Java](Javaserver/ITSchool/src/main/java/demoschool/ITSchool/services/FirstProblemServices.java)<br>
Solution in Python:[Python](Pythonserver/problems/responses/FirstProblem.py)<br>

## Second problem:

Calculate the area and perimeter of a right triangle that has the 2 sides given.<br>
Solution in Java:[Java](Javaserver/ITSchool/src/main/java/demoschool/ITSchool/services/SecondProblemServices.java)<br>
Solution in Python:[Python](Pythonserver/problems/responses/SecondProblem.py)<br>

## Currency Convertor:

Currency Convertor <br>
Solution in Java:[Java](Javaserver/ITSchool/src/main/java/demoschool/ITSchool/services/CurrencyConvertorServices.java)<br>
Solution in Python:[Python](Pythonserver/problems/responses/CurrencyConvertor.py)<br>

***Note: For this problem the Java server needs to have the python server up in order to get the exchange rates.***

## Accounts Manager:

Store accounts informations like: name of the account, password, email, etc. You are able to add accounts to different websites but you can't use
the same name or email.</br>
Solution in Java:[Java](Javaserver/ITSchool/src/main/java/demoschool/ITSchool/services/AccountManagementServices.java)<br>
Solution in Python:[Python](Pythonserver/problems/responses/AccountManagement.py)<br>
